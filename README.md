## Improve Healthcare:

- Using datasets provided at various sources [1](http://mospi.nic.in/statistical-year-book-india/2018/199) and [2](https://data.gov.in/resources/number-cases-and-deaths-due-diseases-india-2000-2010), generate useful information regarding most deaths by diseases, by state.
- Your foremost basic task is to create data, the datasets provided are very generalised and heterogenous so you have to do data cleaning and integration.
- Create a system which dynamically shows predicted trends and provides a complete overview.
- Flagged regions should be provided with better healthcare equipment and more doctors.
- Predict nationwide disease outbreak and come up with a solution to counter if such an incident is to happen.
