voidhacks 2019 HealthTech project 

## Improve Healthcare:

- Using datasets provided at various sources [1] and [2], generate useful information regarding most deaths by diseases, by state.
- Your foremost basic task is to create data, the datasets provided are very generalised and heterogenous so you have to do data cleaning and integration.
- Create a system which dynamically shows predicted trends and provides a complete overview.
- Flagged regions should be provided with better healthcare equipment and more doctors.
- Predict nationwide disease outbreak and come up with a solution to counter if such an incident is to happen.
